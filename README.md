# Bootstrap-portfolio



## Description

In this challenge, I was able to learn and implement using bootstrap to create website,how to find what you are looking for on bootstrap and customise it to be used anyway i want it,from nav bars through jumbotron and cards all the way down to the footer. Then in CSS do some slight adjustments to make it look a little bit prettier.



## Usage

In top left corner is navigation bar with links once clicked will direct you to relevant sections.
In projects section there are cards with images and buttons once clicked will direct you to my previous projects except the last one which will direct you to current project 4.
In Contact section I included some contact details which on hover change colouring and some shading as well.

Here are a  screenshot of the website.
